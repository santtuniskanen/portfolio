# DevOps Developer Portfolio
The goal of this project is to keep growing my Software Engineering skills by building, testing and debugging a web application. I am also learning different DevOps tools, like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.

# The Web Application
Initially the idea was to build a simple web app and I had decided to go for a developer portfolio, since I didn't have one before. I chose to write the website with React using the Next framework and style it with Tailwind.
