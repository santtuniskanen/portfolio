# project portfolio website
This project is part of my summer education. The project foundations are built using the [IBM DevOps](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/devops-and-software-engineering) course at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

# Objective
The objective is to build a portfolio website to showcase some of my qualifications and achivements, 
whether it's based on education or my hobbies. Since this is a DevOps Software Engineering project, I need to incorporate more than a few DevOps tools and practices within the project, like deployment, pipelines or metrics tracking.

## Setting a few goals:
<li>Set up a pipeline to merge changes</li>
<li>Automated testing</li>
<li>Storing artifact into Github Container Registry</li>
<li>Deploying to a CaaS like Azure Container Instances</li>
<li>Adding some metrics tracking</li>
