# Portfolio

This portfolio was originally made in Summer 2023, and it was written with JavaScript. Since then, I've grown a lot as both a person and a developer, so I decided to rewrite it. This is also a very good chance to learn some TypeScript and I'm also trying out [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the JavaScript runtime instead of node, or yarn, which I used last time.
